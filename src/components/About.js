          Sean Sanchez is a multi-instrumentalist that holds a Bachelor of Arts
          in Music with an emphasis in Classical Guitar from the University of
          North Carolina Wilmington, and a teaching certification from the
          Suzuki Association of the Americas. With 22 years of experience, he
          fell in love with music at age 12 upon receiving his first guitar.
          Playing guitar quickly became his greatest passion as he learned how
          to play songs by his favorite artists, especially his biggest
          inspiration, Jimi Hendrix. Sean has performed across the state of
          North Carolina in various rock, funk, and jazz bands, with pit
          orchestras, and with the UNCW Guitar Quartet. New to San Diego, Sean
          is looking forward to performing in Southern California and sharing
          his passion for music with students of all ages and skill levels. His
          teaching style is designed to make learning fun and to provide anyone
          with the skills necessary to experience the joy of music.
