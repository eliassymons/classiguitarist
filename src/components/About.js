          Sean Sanchez is a multi-instrumentalist that holds a Bachelor of Arts
          in Music with an emphasis in Classical Guitar from the University of
          North Carolina Wilmington, and a teaching certification from the
          Suzuki Association of the Americas. With over 25 years of experience,
          he fell in love with music at age 12 upon receiving his first guitar.
          Playing guitar quickly became his greatest passion as he learned how
          to play songs by his favorite artists, especially his biggest
          inspiration, Jimi Hendrix. Later, he began studying classical guitar
          and piano and fell in love with music all over again. Sean has
          performed across Southern California at venues like Belly Up, Music
          Box, Casbah, Harvard and Stone, and internationally at the Baja Blues
          Fest, as well as across the state of North Carolina in various rock,
          funk, and jazz bands, with pit orchestras, and with the UNCW Guitar
          Quartet. He enjoys sharing his passion for music with students of all
          ages and skill levels. His teaching style is designed to make learning
          fun and to provide anyone with the skills necessary to experience the
          joy of music.
